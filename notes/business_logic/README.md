# Business Logic Index

Purpose: high-signal, low-noise context for the compiler and LSP.
Keep entries concise and update when behavior changes.

Files:
- `overview.md`: quick snapshot and current focus.
- `repo_map.md`: directory map and entry points.
- `pipeline.md`: compilation pipeline and key flags.
- `lsp.md`: LSP server architecture, caches, debug toggles.
- `bootstrap.md`: full-prelude bootstrap status, commands, blockers.
- `debug.md`: debug hooks and tracing flags for codegen/HIR.
