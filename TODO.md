# Crystal V2 Bootstrap TODO

Updated: 2026-04-22
Branch: `codegen`

This is the active working backlog only. Historical detail is in git history,
especially `65eb6f62^:TODO.md`. Reusable evidence lives in `LANDMARKS.md`.

## Goal

Reach a clean bootstrap corridor:

`original -> stage1 -> s2b -> s3b -> s4b -> s5b`

with normalized HIR/MIR/LLVM semantic equivalence across stages.

Working policy:

- Prefer fast `--no-prelude` oracles.
- Use `s1 -> s2b` as the main integration gate.
- Run `s1 -> s5b` rarely, after `s1 -> s2b` is clean.

## Current Checkpoint

Direct `s1 -> s2` now produces a stage2 compiler in the focused gate:

```bash
crystal build src/crystal_v2.cr -o /tmp/cv2_hir_emit_stop --error-trace
CRYSTAL_V2_PHASE_STATS=1 \
  scripts/run_safe.sh /tmp/cv2_hir_emit_stop 300 4096 \
    src/crystal_v2.cr -o /tmp/cv2_s2_hir_emit_stop
```

Verified signal: `[EXIT: 0] after ~265s`, produced `/tmp/cv2_s2_hir_emit_stop`.

Fast stage2 HIR emit also passes:

```bash
regression_tests/p2_selfhost_hir_emit_no_prelude.sh /tmp/cv2_s2_hir_emit_stop
```

Verified signal: `p2_selfhost_hir_emit_no_prelude_ok`.

The full wrapper gate remains the integration command:

```bash
BOOTSTRAP_STAGE_OUT=/tmp/cv2_bs_s2 \
BOOTSTRAP_CHAIN_STAGES=2 \
BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT_SEC=300 \
BOOTSTRAP_MEM_MB=4096 \
  scripts/build_bootstrap_stages.sh --stages 2 --out /tmp/cv2_bs_s2
```

Current diagnosis / recently fixed roots:

- Stage2 shape guard now protects four self-host codegen roots in one MIR
  gate (`regression_tests/p2_selfhost_stage2_shape_guard.sh`):
  - stale cache-only call return repair no longer rewrites
    `Slice(UInt8)#[]` from `UInt8` to stale container-shaped returns;
  - bare `return` in nilable functions now materializes a nil union value
    (`String#byte_index(Int32, Int32)` no longer emits bare MIR `ret`);
  - deferred runtime constants update `@constant_types` after real lowering
    (`CRYSTAL_SRC_PATH` now reads as `String`, not `VOID`, avoiding
    `Path | String` variant miswrap);
  - splat parameters are rebound to tuple locals in the method body, so
    `Dir.glob(*patterns, &block)` no longer self-recurses through its
    `_block_splat` wrapper.
- `Hash(String, Nil).new(block, initial_capacity:)` no longer resolves to the
  `default_value : V` overload. Generic overload matching now evaluates
  annotations in the requested concrete owner context, so `V` is `Nil` for
  `Hash(String, Nil)` instead of a wildcard.
- Explicit receiver block calls now keep the concrete generic receiver owner
  when searching block thunks. This removes late generic-module abort stubs such
  as `Indexable(T)#reverse_each$$block`; the self-host HIR trace now lowers
  concrete `Array(...)#reverse_each$block` targets instead.
- Default argument expansion now searches included module chains before final
  target canonicalization. This preserves `Enumerable#each_with_index(offset =
  0, &)` when reached through concrete Array/Slice owners, so zero-arg block
  calls become one-arg calls before block proc lowering.
- Direct LLVM small-Hash linear-scan overrides are disabled. They duplicated
  `Hash::Entry` layout knowledge in the backend and corrupted self-hosted
  `Hash(String, Nil)` / `Hash(String, T)` paths; normal HIR/MIR lowering now
  owns those method bodies.
- Exact-demand helper bodies invalidated by layout repair are requeued and can
  be processed again in the same pending pass. This removed late abort stubs for
  `Array(String)#increase_capacity` and `Array(Crystal::HIR::TypeRef)#to_unsafe`.
- HIR-only emit no longer depends on backend/runtime weak spots:
  - `--emit hir --no-link` stops after writing HIR when MIR/LLVM emit is not
    requested.
  - HIR pretty-printers avoid `Enumerable#join(io, ...)`, which pulled
    `IO::FileDescriptor#tell`.
  - CLI HIR output uses the same `LibC.open` / `LibC.close` pattern as LLVM
    output instead of `File.open` / `IO::FileDescriptor#system_close`.

Remaining risk:

- The current generated stage2 still times out on a minimal no-prelude compile:
  `scripts/run_safe.sh /tmp/cv2_s2_splat_tuple_guard 30 2048
  /tmp/cv2_no_prelude_expr_splat_tuple_guard.cr --no-prelude --no-codegen`.
  Latest sample points at `__crystal_v2_string_eq` / earlier at
  `Indexable.range_to_index_and_count -> Range(Int32, Int32)#begin`. Treat this
  as the next root-cause target before any `s3b+` attempt.
- Stage2 still has a separate generic module block corridor around
  `Enumerable(T)#any?$$block`. A no-prelude function-definition HIR emit and a
  full `puts 42` smoke can still hang/abort there under the generated s2
  compiler. A broader implicit-self block receiver experiment was refuted
  because it caused an early `Index out of bounds` in self-host HIR lowering.
- `lower_missing` still grows HIR heavily during full self-compile
  (`~25k -> ~54k` functions in the latest focused s2 build). This no longer
  blocks producing s2 in the current gate, but it remains the main demand-driven
  cleanup target.
- Dominant families are broad fallback helpers on compiler-internal containers:
  `Array#to_s`, `Array#inspect`, `Array#exec_recursive`,
  `Array#object_id`, `Hash#to_s`, `Hash#inspect`,
  `Hash#exec_recursive`, and `Hash::Entry#to_s/#inspect`.
- Current source contexts:
  - `Object#to_s` enqueues `Array#to_s` / `Hash#to_s`
  - `Object#inspect` enqueues `Array#inspect` / `Hash#inspect`
  - `Reference#same?` enqueues `Array#object_id`
  - `Dir::Globber#glob` enqueues some `Hash#each`
- `DEBUG_RTA_KEEP_REASONS=1` shows the active `process_pending` frontier is
  dominated by `keep:exact_called`, not by owner/method-part fallback:
  `Array#to_s`, `Array#object_id`, `Hash#to_s`, `Hash#object_id`,
  `Hash::Entry#to_s`.
- `scripts/timeout_sample_lldb.sh` confirms the time is spent in HIR lowering /
  type-name lookup / string hashing, consistent with excessive admitted wrapper
  volume rather than a single tight runtime loop.

## Refuted Fix Branches

Do not retry without new evidence:

- Broad `Object` / `Reference` virtual-target replay gating alone.
- `emit_all_tracked_signatures` universal-method pruning alone.
- Replay gating plus emit pruning combination.
- Defer/enqueue guard for universal helpers on deep generic owners.
- RTA replay-depth guard that prevents speculative replay enqueues from marking
  exact `@rta_called_methods`.
- `rta_method_part_matches_owner?` broad-root helper ancestor filter.
  - No movement on `p2_root_self_replay_no_prelude.sh`: `process_delta=20`,
    `object_replays=28`, `reference_replays=21` unchanged.
- Combined broad-root immediate-replay gate plus broad-root helper RTA filter.
  - Synthetic oracle reduced replay counts (`Object 28->16`, `Reference 21->16`)
    but not `process_delta` or `total`.
  - 120s `STOP_AFTER_HIR` diagnostic still timed out, with queue reaching `40k`
    and the same helper families (`Array#to_json`, `Array#inspect`,
    `Array#to_s`, `Array#exec_recursive`, `Array#hash`, `Hash#...`).

Common lesson: name-family containment can remove individual symptoms but has
not yet removed the underlying broad fallback demand leak.

## Fast Oracles

Run before expensive bootstrap attempts:

```bash
regression_tests/p2_bootstrap_semantic_emit_oracle.sh bin/crystal_v2
regression_tests/p2_selfhost_hir_emit_no_prelude.sh bin/crystal_v2
regression_tests/p2_pending_budget_no_prelude.sh bin/crystal_v2
regression_tests/p2_root_self_replay_no_prelude.sh bin/crystal_v2
regression_tests/p2_universal_helper_fanout_no_prelude.sh bin/crystal_v2
regression_tests/p2_selfhost_stage2_shape_guard.sh bin/crystal_v2
```

Expected current signals:

- `p2_bootstrap_semantic_emit_oracle_ok`
- `p2_selfhost_hir_emit_no_prelude_ok`
- `p2_pending_budget_no_prelude_ok ... total=103 max_queue=57`
- `p2_root_self_replay_no_prelude_ok process_delta=20 total=47 ...`
- `p2_universal_helper_fanout_no_prelude_ok deep_helpers=0`
- `p2_selfhost_stage2_shape_guard_ok`

Boundary: `src/crystal_v2.cr --no-prelude` still exits `11` in an
inline-yield recursion / force-return corridor before it can serve as a green
pending-budget oracle.

## Next Work

1. Run the full `scripts/build_bootstrap_stages.sh --stages 2` wrapper gate and
   confirm it produces the same s2 result as the direct command above.
2. Fix the current generated-stage2 no-prelude hang around string/range
   primitives before treating the produced s2 as usable for corpus comparison.
3. Compare `s1_bootstrap` and `s2b` on the fixed no-prelude corpus before
   trying `s3b+`.
4. Add/inspect exact-called provenance for `record_pending_callee_for_rta` so
   the source of remaining `keep:exact_called Array#to_s` / `Hash#to_s` demand
   is explicit.
5. Verify whether broad fallback self-calls should mark exact concrete wrapper
   names as demanded, or whether they should remain virtual/demand-local until a
   real callsite asks for that concrete owner.

## Stop Conditions

- Do not run `s3b+` until the wrapper `s1 -> s2b` gate and normalized corpus
  comparison are green.
- Do not increase timeout or memory to hide pending expansion.
- Do not modify stdlib/runtime.
- Do not land another name-family guard unless it measurably reduces the
  `~61k` process-pending expansion.
- If two more bounded containment fixes fail, pivot from heuristics to explicit
  demand-provenance design.

## Strategic Track

Architecture target:

- `PLAN_DEMAND_DRIVEN_REWRITE.md`
- `PLAN_DEMAND_DRIVEN_REWRITE_RFC.md`

Current short-term track: bootstrap containment plus fast no-prelude oracle
coverage, not a full compile-path switch.
