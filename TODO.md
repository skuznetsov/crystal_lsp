# Crystal V2 Bootstrap — TODO (Updated 2026-03-23)

## Current Status
- **Branch**: `bootstrap-benchmark` (merged `inline-structs`)
- **Regression baseline**: last broadly re-verified count from the earlier inline-struct phase was `87/88 + 18/20`; later parser/HIR/bootstrap changes have not re-established that full baseline yet
- **Fresh release bootstrap measurements**:
  - original compiler -> current `stage1 --release`: green in `525.13s real` (~8m45s), peak memory footprint `7230019776` bytes (`max resident set size 8062320640`)
  - current `stage1 --release` -> self-hosted `stage2 --release`: green in `[EXIT: 0] after ~163s`, `/usr/bin/time -l = 190.31s real`, output `/tmp/stage2_release_88dfb7f6`
  - self-hosted `stage2 --release` -> `stage3 --release`: still red; `scripts/run_safe.sh ... 1200 12288` times out with no output binary after `1200s`
  - current speed comparison is only a lower bound: `stage2` compiler is at least `1200 / 525.13 ~= 2.29x` slower than stage1 on `src/crystal_v2.cr --release`, because the stage3 build did not finish inside the safe timeout
- **Fresh self-hosted lexer stabilization**:
  - release candidate `/tmp/stage2_release_lexerscanfix_v4` builds green from current source via original `stage1` in `194.59s real`, `[EXIT: 0] after ~167s`
  - self-hosted `stage2 --release --no-prelude` parse-only now survives numeric literals that previously hung or blew memory in lexer preload: `1`, `1_2`, `1.5`, `1e2`, `1_f32`, `1i64`, `1u8`
  - new green regression: `regression_tests/stage2_numeric_literal_parse_repro.sh`
  - root-cause chain for this corridor:
    - `lex_number` integer scan self-looped in self-hosted release on `1\n`
    - after fixing digit scan, `lex_newline` tokenized `\n` forever without advancing
    - after fixing newline/whitespace, decimal/exponent/`_f32` paths still leaked into `lex_operator` or suffix scanning because single-byte consumes inside `lex_number`/`lex_number_suffix` were still using fragile `advance`/loop shapes
- **Fresh parser stabilization**: forcing `AstArena` in parser bootstrap removes the bogus self-hosted `PageArena` path (`DEBUG_ARENA_ADD` now shows sane `id=0` instead of negative PageArena ids)
- **Fresh macro parser stabilization**:
  - boxed `parse_macro_body` depth counters survive ordinary text-token iterations in self-hosted stage2
  - `macro probe(*methods)` oracle now consumes both inner `{% end %}` markers and no longer leaks extra top-level `MacroLiteral` / `Identifier` roots
- **Fresh parser stabilization**:
  - `parse_parenthesized_call` now restores `@parsing_call_args` on the ordinary return path instead of relying on the old broad outer `ensure`
  - new reduced trailing-block oracle flips old self-hosted stage2 red -> green:
    `regression_tests/stage2_parenthesized_block_call_args_repro.sh`
  - stronger downstream signal moved as well: `stage2_object_parse_noprelude_repro.sh` is now green `5/5` on the new self-hosted stage2 candidate
- **Fresh HIR stabilization**:
  - generic param recursion guard no longer crashes hashing `Pointer(UInt8)` in `type_ref_for_name_inner`
  - `CRYSTAL_V2_STOP_AFTER_HIR=1` on the macro oracle is now green and produces a deterministic stage1-vs-stage2 HIR diff instead of a segfault
- **Fresh reduced post-parse stabilization**:
  - constructor-time `Time::Instant?` init in `AstToHir` no longer self-hosted-crashes immediately after parse on the reduced trailing-block carrier
  - `Function` now stores raw parameter snapshots directly instead of a nested parameter object container
  - MIR `convert_type` now dispatches on raw `type_id` instead of `TypeRef` struct equality, removing the self-hosted `Int32 -> Type#24` regression
  - on the reduced `callargs_leak_reduced.cr` oracle, current-source `stage1` and self-hosted `stage2` now match byte-for-byte at both HIR and MIR
- **Fresh HIR analysis stabilization**:
  - `EscapeAnalyzer` and `TaintAnalyzer` no longer rely on Crystal stdlib `Hash` default-proc writes for `@users`
  - self-hosted stage2 no longer dies in `Missing hash key: 3` / `propagate_escapes` while building compiler MIR
- **Fresh LLVM nil-slot stabilization**:
  - cross-block `Cast ... : Nil` / `Cast ... : Void` values now take the default-slot-store path instead of tripping `LLVM_MISSING_VALUE`
  - the concrete failing optimizer paths were self-hosted `inttoptr ... : Nil` chains inside `Crystal::MIR::PeepholePass#run` and `Crystal::MIR::CopyPropagationPass#run`
  - new bootstrap regression script: `regression_tests/stage2_nil_slot_bootstrap_repro.sh`
- **Focused green oracles**:
  - stage2 float literal parse/FastFloat accessor stub repro is green
  - stage2 `case/when` with `Char` literals inside defs is green
  - narrow literal oracle is green (`literal 42 : Int32`, not `literal nil`)
  - reduced trailing-block call-args oracle is green on the new stage2 candidate
  - `src/stdlib/object.cr --release --no-prelude` parse-only repro is green `5/5` on the new stage2 candidate
  - reduced trailing-block carrier now reaches `CRYSTAL_V2_STOP_AFTER_MIR=1` on self-hosted stage2 and matches current-source stage1 MIR output
  - full self-hosted stage2 debug bootstrap now reaches deep LLVM generation without any `LLVM_MISSING_VALUE` diagnostics on the old `PeepholePass#run` / `CopyPropagationPass#run` nil-slot frontier
  - full self-hosted `stage2 --release` bootstrap is green from current `HEAD` via `/tmp/stage1_release_88dfb7f6 -> /tmp/stage2_release_88dfb7f6`
- **Focused red oracles**:
  - `regression_tests/stage2_numeric_literal_mir_oracle.sh` now isolates the next post-parse blocker: self-hosted stage2 parses numeric literals but still lowers them to `const nil` in MIR (`1`, `1_2`, `1i64`, `1u8`)
  - mixed numeric `--emit hir` on self-hosted stage2 still aborts in `Printer$Dshortest$$Float64_IO` before artifact write, so float-literal HIR diffing is blocked by a separate printer stub issue
  - tiny `1\n --no-prelude --emit llvm-ir --no-link` on `/tmp/stage2_release_lexerscanfix_v4` still segfaults in LLVM generation after MIR succeeds
  - reduced trailing-block no-prelude carrier no longer diverges in HIR/MIR, but self-hosted stage2 still segfaults in LLVM generation when allowed past MIR on the same carrier
  - stage3 bootstrap still dies while parsing `src/stdlib/object.cr`
  - `stage2_process_executable_path_parse_repro.sh` is now flaky on the new stage2 candidate (`attempt 1 = green`, `attempt 2 = 139`)
  - full `char_toplevel` compile on self-hosted stage2 still segfaults after parse
  - full self-hosted stage2 debug bootstrap under `scripts/run_safe.sh ... 600 4096` is now killed by memory growth at `4231664KB > 4096MB` after ~293s during LLVM generation
  - self-hosted `stage2 --release` -> `stage3 --release` currently times out after `1200s` under `run_safe` with no output binary
- **Current frontier**: numeric literal lexing is no longer the blocker for self-hosted stage2 parse-only work, but the next blocker is immediately downstream: self-hosted stage2 still lowers numeric literals to `nil` in MIR and still crashes in tiny LLVM emission / float-literal HIR printing. Once literal value transport is restored past HIR/MIR printing, re-run the numeric oracles first, then go back to the stage3 timeout-class slowdown.

## VERIFIED: Fix `ptr 0` → `ptr null` in stage2 LLC

### Done:
- `emit_select`: normalizes ptr 0 → ptr null ✓
- `emit` helper: gsub normalization ✓
- `emit_raw`: gsub normalization ✓
- Worker temp file output (IO.copy): normalization ✓
- Parent output (IO.copy): normalization ✓
- Line-aware normalization skips LLVM string constants like `c"ptr 0,\00"` ✓

### Test:
```bash
crystal build src/crystal_v2.cr -o bin/crystal_v2 --error-trace
bin/crystal_v2 src/crystal_v2.cr -o /tmp/crystal_v2_s2
# Should compile without LLC error
```

If `ptr 0` still appears, check `emit_toplevel` (@output << s at line ~2571).

## VERIFIED: Test Stage2 Oracle

Once stage2 compiles without LLC error:
```bash
echo '42' > /tmp/test.cr
CRYSTAL_V2_STOP_AFTER_MIR=1 /tmp/crystal_v2_s2 /tmp/test.cr -o /tmp/out --no-prelude --emit hir
# Expected: literal 42 : Int32 (NOT literal nil)
```

- `Literal` has `int_value`/`float_value` primitive bypass fields
- `Literal#to_s` uses `@type`-based dispatch (not `@value` union)
- `lower_number` sets `lit.int_value = node.parsed_int`
- `NumberNode.parsed_int` pre-parses at constructor time

## NEXT: Fresh Release Bootstrap + Benchmark

1. Build fresh release stage1 from current repo state.
2. Build fresh release stage2 with that stage1 and measure peak RSS / progress through LLVM generation under `scripts/run_safe.sh`.
3. Localize why `stage2 --release` takes >1200s on the stage3 bootstrap path despite stage1 finishing the same workload in `525.13s` and stage2 itself building in `190.31s`.
4. Re-run `regression_tests/stage2_nil_slot_bootstrap_repro.sh` on the next bootstrap candidate before chasing lower performance issues, so the old `LLVM_MISSING_VALUE` nil-slot bug stays closed.
5. Re-run `stage2_default_prelude_parse_repro.sh` and `stage2_process_executable_path_parse_repro.sh` once the stage3 timeout-class slowdown is understood.
6. Retry stage3 bootstrap after the self-hosted release slowdown is fixed or bounded to a smaller reproducer.
7. When stage3 goes green, record the exact stage1 vs stage2 release compile-time delta for `src/crystal_v2.cr`.

## ROOT CAUSES FOUND

### 1. Union tag stripping (CRITICAL, partially fixed)
- `llvm_backend.cr:14226-14235`: extracts union PAYLOAD, drops TAG
- `llvm_backend.cr:2599-2605`: same in fixup_call_arg_types
- Fixed: pass ptr to full union alloca
- But callee wraps ptr as `{tag=0, payload=ptr}` → still Nil
- **Full fix needed**: pass unions by value or memcpy on callee side

### 2. Struct-as-pointer ABI (ARCHITECTURAL, plan exists)
- `llvm_backend.cr:236`: `when .struct? then "ptr"`
- All structs heap-allocated as pointers
- Should be inline (value types) like original Crystal
- See `PLAN_INLINE_STRUCTS.md`

### 3. Dangling struct pointers (WORKAROUND applied)
- Slice/Span heap objects freed between parse and HIR lowering
- Workaround: NumberNode.parsed_int/parsed_float + Literal.int_value/float_value

## STAGE2 WORKAROUNDS (10 bypasses in cli.cr)
1. File.exists? → LibC.access
2. File.read → LibC.open/read/close
3. File.open → LibC.open + IO::FileDescriptor
4. Pipeline cache: DISABLED
5. AST cache: DISABLED
6. Set constants → case/when
7. SHA256 → FNV-1a
8. flag?/has_constant? → return false
9. Object#==(T) → return false
10. Void→Nil forwarding for Hash methods
