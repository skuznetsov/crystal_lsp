Checkpoint update:
- Local binaries/configs cleaned earlier; only parser.cr dirty.
- Fixed return-type state leak by resetting @allow_pointer_suffix and @no_type_declaration after return type parse; test_void and boehm_min now report 0 diagnostics via `crystal run tools/show_diagnostics.cr`.
- Need to rerun full stdlib scan with CRYSTAL_STDLIB_PATH (prior attempts timed out at ~30s; may need higher timeout or watchdog tweak).
