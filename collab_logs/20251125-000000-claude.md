# Claude Status Update - Parser Recovery Noise Analysis

## Current Status

**Stdlib scan results:** 77 files / 129 diagnostics (improved from GPT-5's 81/171)

## Top Diagnostic Pattern: Macro + Nested Named Args

**Root cause for spec/helpers/iterate.cr (6 diags):**

Pattern: Macro with two calls that have named args, where each call's body contains another call with named args.

### Minimal Reproduction

```crystal
macro test_it(description, expected, method, *, infinite = false, file = __FILE__, line = __LINE__)
  it {{ "#{description} test1" }}, file: {{ file }}, line: {{ line }} do
    foo {{ expected }}, {{ method }}, infinite: {{ infinite }}
  end
  it {{ "#{description} test2" }}, file: {{ file }}, line: {{ line }} do
    bar {{ expected }}, {{ method }}, infinite: {{ infinite }}
  end
end
```

→ 6 diagnostics: "recovered unexpected Colon" + "recovered unexpected MacroExprStart" on second `it` call

### Key Observations

1. **Single `it`** with named args + body call: 0 diags ✓
2. **Two `it`** with named args but empty/simple bodies: 0 diags ✓
3. **Two `it`** with named args + **both bodies have named arg calls**: 6 diags ✗

### Hypothesis

Parser state corruption when:
- Parsing nested `identifier: {{macro}}` patterns
- Inside `do...end` blocks
- With multiple sequential occurrences

**Next steps:** Investigate `parse_parenthesized_call` / `parse_call_args` state management around macro expressions in named arguments.
